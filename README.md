## üìù **Project Overview: Text Summarization Tool**

### üîç **Project Objective:**

The main objective of this task is to **build a Python-based text summarization tool** that can automatically extract and generate concise summaries from lengthy articles or input text. The tool should leverage **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to identify and retain the most important information while reducing the overall text size.

This simulates a real-world NLP application useful in news aggregation, research paper summarization, chatbots, and digital assistants.

### ‚úÖ **Key Activities:**

1. **Understanding NLP Fundamentals:**

   * Learn how text preprocessing works (tokenization, stop words, cleaning).
   * Understand extractive summarization techniques.

2. **Tool Development in Python:**

   * Design and implement a Python script for summarization.
   * Use libraries like `nltk`, `re`, and `heapq` for text processing and scoring.
   * Tokenize text into sentences and words.
   * Compute word frequency to rank sentences by importance.

3. **Text Summarization Logic:**

   * Score each sentence based on word frequency.
   * Select top-ranked sentences to form the summary.
   * Output both the original and summarized text.

4. **Testing and Optimization:**

   * Test the tool with different input text lengths and structures.
   * Adjust parameters like number of summary sentences for optimal results.

5. **Documentation:**

   * Comment the code for clarity.
   * Prepare a short write-up explaining how the tool works.

6. **Deliverable Submission:**

   * Final Python script (.py) showing both input and summarized output.
   * Can be expanded later to include GUI or file input/output features.

### üéØ **Expected Output:**

* A working Python script that:

  * Accepts long-form text.
  * Returns a short, meaningful summary.
* Demonstrates the application of NLP techniques.
* Can be used as a base for more advanced summarizers (e.g., using `spaCy`, `transformers`, or `GPT` APIs later).
